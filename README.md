# imdb_movies_data_analysis

This project was done motivated by a wish of applyig some basic python data analysis tools. 
I did a quick analysis to a movie data set provided by IMDB where u could find some movie features as duration, budget, etc.
It got data from movies since 1920 untill 2017 aproximatly. 

I tried to get some facts about the data in order to conclude something interesting.

I hope this notebook to be helpful to show how to apply some simple techniques.
